# Infinite Scroll | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 2/20**

This is a **dynamic image gallery** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that uses the **Unsplash API** to fetch and display random images with **infinite scrolling**. When the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, more photos are automatically loaded.

> ⚠️ **Important:** You must use your own **Unsplash API key** to make this project work. Visit [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) to register and obtain an API key.
